> # Telco-Customer-Churn-Analysis 2024
> Data analysis and visualization of customer churn for a telecom company

> ## Client Overview

> The Telco company is a large telecommunications provider offering internet, phone, and streaming services across multiple regions. Like most subscription-based businesses, profitability depends on long-term customer retention, predictable recurring revenue (MRR), and the ability to reduce churn across high-value segments.

> The Telco Churn Dashboard 2024 consolidates customer behavior, contract types, service usage, revenue contribution, and churn risk into a single analytics view. The goal is to provide a clear understanding of why customers leave, which customer groups are at highest risk, and what strategies can improve retention and lifetime value (CLV).

> ## Business Objectives

> 1. Identify customer segments with the highest churn risk.

> 2. Understand how contract type, payment method, internet service, and tech support influence churn.

> 3. Quantify revenue impact by measuring MRR at risk and customer lifetime value (CLV).

> 4. Support data-driven retention strategies that reduce voluntary churn.

> 5. Enable the business to forecast churn trends and prioritize high-value customer retention.

> ## Key Metrics

> - Churn Rate: 26.58% — significantly above the industry benchmark of ~20%.
